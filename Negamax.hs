-- Let's have some fun with the Either monad in the alpha-beta pruning algorithm
-- Left means that the pruning is finished
-- Right means that the search is going on
-- Now the alpha-beta pruning can be nicely expressed as a fold in terms
-- of the Either monad. The fold _could_ be implemented equally well in
-- without the monad, but the abstraction makes the control flow somewhat
-- clearer by stating explicitly if the pruning is finished in the middle
-- of the fold.
--
-- N.B. This function must be applied to a nonempty list [a]!
-- Otherwise no sensible results are guaranteed.
